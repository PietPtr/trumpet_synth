# Trumpet Fingering Practice Tool

Chromatic / Electric / Melodic / Expressive / Portable

Goals:
- Simple binary (cherry linear) switches for inputting right-hand fingerings
- Intuitive way to input embouchure (i.e. which overtone plays on the tube)
- Intuitive way to input blow strength or other modulation
- Portable
- Silent (i.e. headphone support and no input noise)
- Sounds vaguely trumpet like
- Uses tube lengths to calculate note frequency, not notenames
- No tuning slides, assumes use on the usual sharp notes
- maybe some trimmers for tuning?
- i2c pins available on pcb for expansion with breath controller
